  abstract = {Differences within species (Intraspecific trait variation - ITV) contribute substantially to overall trait variability and environmental harshness can reduce among-species variation. While aboveground traits have received considerable attention, knowledge about ITV in fine-root traits and how it differs from ITV in aboveground traits remains limited. This study examined the partitioning of trait variation aboveground and fine-root traits in 52 European herbaceous species and how such proportions change in response to drought, offering valuable insights for accurate functional species characterization and inter-species comparisons. We studied seven morphological aboveground and fine-root traits under drought and well-watered conditions in a greenhouse experiment. Linear mixed effect models and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were employed to decompose trait variation, ensuring the robustness of our results. We also calculated variance partitioning for the combination of aboveground traits and the combination of fine-root traits, as well as pairs of analogous leaf and fine-root traits (i.e., traits that fulfill similar functions) for each treatment (control and drought). Among-species trait differences explained a greater proportion of overall variance than within-species variation, except for root dry matter content (RDMC). Height and leaf area stood out, with species' identity accounting for 87-90\% of total trait variation. Drought had no significant effect on the proportions of variation in any of the traits. However, the combination of fine-root traits exhibited higher intraspecific variability (44-44\%) than aboveground traits (19-21\%) under both drought and control. Analogous root traits also showed higher ITV (51-50\%) than analogous leaf traits (27-31\%). Our findings highlight substantial within-species variation and the nuanced responses of fine-root traits, particularly RDMC, suggesting root traits' flexibility to soil heterogeneity that fosters less differentiation among species. Among-species trait differences, especially aboveground, may underscore distinct strategies and competitive abilities for resource acquisition and utilization. This study contributes to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the multifunctionality of the above- and belowground plants compartments.},
