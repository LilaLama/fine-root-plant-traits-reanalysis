# Methods
## Exploration of patterns
1. Quantify how much variation in trait space is explained by growth form, family, and biomes using PERMANOVA (vegan::adonis) on Euclidean distance matrices computed from species trait coordinates (single traits, PCA components, and full PCA space).

Implementation notes: the script computes Euclidean distances via base::dist(...) on single traits or on PCA scores and passes them to adonis() to extract R² (the code currently uses permutations = 0 to extract R² only; set permutations > 0 to get permutation p-values).

2. Measure dissimilarity among groups using TPD-based community dissimilarity and compare it to climate dissimilarity. 
   → Do different environments host different trait pools?

Implementation notes: community-level trait probability densities are built with TPDc(...) from the TPD package and dissimilarities computed with dissim(...). Climate dissimilarity between biomes is computed with FD::gowdis (Gower distance). Matrix comparisons use vegan::mantel and major-axis regression (lmodel2) on as.dist(...) of the dissimilarity matrices.

3. Assess redundancy (functional richness) using TPDRichness and null-model simulations.
    → How much unused or overlapping trait space exists inside each environment?

Implementation notes: observed FRic (TPDRichness or TPDRichness_large) is calculated per group (families, biomes, woody/non-woody) and compared against a null distribution generated by randomized reassignment of species to groups while preserving group sizes (nreps = 4999 in the script) to evaluate expected FRic and significance.
