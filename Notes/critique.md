# Points of Critique

## 1. Definition of fine-roots

## 2. Missing differentiation between intra- and interspecific trait variability
Carmona et al. (2021) conclude that the variation in aboveground traits is greater than that in belowground traits. However, they do not explicitly account for the distinction between intra- and interspecific variation.
Rodríguez-Alarcón et al. (2024) complement this perspective by examining intraspecific variation separately. They show that, for the European herbaceous species studied, intraspecific variation in fine-root traits is greater than that in aboveground traits.
