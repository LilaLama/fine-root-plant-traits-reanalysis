### Executing the following code in order performs the main analyses and figures presented in the manuscript "Vascular plant trait diversity is globally higher above- than belowground" by Carmona et al. Before running it, the working directory must be set so that it contains the different .R files, and the data files provided are within a subfolder called "data"
# After each script we show the execution time in a Windows 10 PC (Intel i7-8700 CPU 3.2GHz, RAM 32GB. R version 3.6.0), for reference
# note that a series of packages have to be installed and loaded for the different scripts to run properly:
library(paran)
library(psych)
library(TPD)
library(shape) #Only used for plotting
library(RColorBrewer) #Only used for plotting
library(ade4)
library(mvtnorm)
library(missForest)
library(V.PhyloMaker)
library(vegan)
library(FD)
library(lmodel2)
library(plotbiomes)
library(plotrix)
library(here)
